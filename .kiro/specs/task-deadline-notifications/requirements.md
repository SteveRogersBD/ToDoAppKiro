# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Task Deadline Notifications feature will enhance the TodoApp by providing users with timely reminders about upcoming task deadlines. This system will help users stay on track with their tasks by sending notifications at configurable intervals before deadlines expire. The feature will include both Android local notifications and backend scheduling capabilities to ensure reliable delivery across app states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications before my task deadlines, so that I can complete tasks on time and avoid missing important deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task has a deadline set THEN the system SHALL schedule a notification to be sent before the deadline
2. WHEN the scheduled notification time arrives THEN the system SHALL display a notification to the user with task details
3. WHEN a user taps on a notification THEN the system SHALL open the app and navigate to the specific task
4. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL cancel any pending notifications for that task
5. WHEN a task deadline is modified THEN the system SHALL reschedule the notification accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize when I receive deadline notifications, so that I can set reminders that fit my workflow and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing notification settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to set default notification timing (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week before deadline)
2. WHEN creating or editing a task THEN the system SHALL allow users to set custom notification timing for that specific task
3. WHEN a user disables notifications THEN the system SHALL not send any deadline notifications
4. IF a user sets multiple notification times for a task THEN the system SHALL send notifications at each specified interval

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want notifications to work even when the app is closed, so that I don't miss important deadlines regardless of app usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in the background THEN the system SHALL still deliver scheduled notifications
2. WHEN the device is restarted THEN the system SHALL restore all pending notification schedules
3. WHEN the app is force-closed THEN the system SHALL continue to deliver notifications through system-level scheduling
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN local notifications SHALL still function for previously scheduled tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my notification history and preferences, so that I can control my notification experience and review past alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing notification settings THEN the system SHALL display current notification preferences
2. WHEN viewing notification history THEN the system SHALL show previously sent notifications with timestamps
3. WHEN a notification is dismissed THEN the system SHALL record the dismissal action
4. IF a user wants to snooze a notification THEN the system SHALL provide snooze options (5 min, 15 min, 1 hour)
5. WHEN multiple notifications are pending THEN the system SHALL group them appropriately to avoid notification spam

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want different types of notifications for different urgency levels, so that I can prioritize my attention based on task importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task deadline is within 1 hour THEN the system SHALL send a high-priority notification with urgent styling
2. WHEN a task deadline is within 1 day THEN the system SHALL send a medium-priority notification
3. WHEN a task deadline is within 1 week THEN the system SHALL send a low-priority notification
4. WHEN a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL send a critical priority notification with distinct visual and audio cues
5. IF a task has a custom priority level THEN the notification SHALL reflect that priority in its presentation
